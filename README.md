# OpenFSW
An open-source Flight Software for a realistic satellite mission, inspired by real space-grade architectures.

## Full tests + simulations (artifacts)

Run the complete validation pipeline (firmware build, Python tests, simulations, ground examples) and generate logs, CSV/JSON data and PNG plots into `build/reports/`:

`python3 tools/run_all.py`

Artifacts are written to:

- `build/reports/latest/` (most recent)
- `build/reports/<timestamp>/` (archived run)
